          <p className="text-base">Do Not Track signals</p>
          <p className="text-base">
            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
            websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
            tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
            in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
            collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who
            use or visit a website or online service as they move across
            different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not
            Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and
            Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track
            signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more
            detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of
            your personal information.

            address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any
            third parties except as allowed in the information use and
            processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third party
            provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent
            via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

            We will comply with applicable anti-spam law, such as the CAN-SPAM
            Act and CASL. All e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the

            sender. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing
            emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these
            emails or by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive
            essential transactional emails.

            clicks through to links or advertisements within the email. We may
            use this information for purposes including determining which of our
            emails are more interesting to users and to query whether users who
            do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them. The pixel
            will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the
            pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should read the email in
            plain text view or with images disabled.
